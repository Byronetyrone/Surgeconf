surge conf to unlock appstore apps like egern does. js is hosted at apptesters. all i did was convertfromegern to surge syntax.

DOESNT ACTUALLY UNLOCK APPS YET. the scripts timeout or judt dont unlock apps. WIP

to test download conf. load in surge. create, install and trust a cert. start surge and load some apps listed under scripting section of apptesters. use restore purchases to... well. nothing. its getting pretty close though. maybe someone will figure it out.
